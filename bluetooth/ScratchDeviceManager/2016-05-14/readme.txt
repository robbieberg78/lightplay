This is the version that was used at Scratch Day 2016. To use:

- unzip the file and transfer it to your application folder in OS X

- open Scratch Device Manager App, you should see an “S” icon appear in the menu extras section at the top right of your screen

Power up the Light Play hardware with the 5V wall wart. (Do not use more than 5V!!!). The red LED on the Arduino mini should tun on steady and the red LED on the Bluetooth board should blink intermittently. 

In a Chrome Browser, open:

https://benberg.scratch.ly

Authentication: 
	username: scratchteam 
	password: 75amherst

- When the main Scratch page opens up, click on the “Create” button, the Scratch editor should open


-  Click on the  More Blocks tab

-  then click on “Add an extension”

- click on the option labelled  “LightPlay 1” . A dialog box should open allowing you to connect to the LightPlay hardware. Shortly after you click on “Connect” a blue LED should light on the Bluetooth board. You should be ready to go. Simplest test is to plug in a light and see if it turns on when you click on the “turn on all lights” block.
