version 1 of the lightplay firmware was made for Lightplay board v. 0.2 and was the version used with the Reggio workshop in October 2016. It uses 1-byte commands and works with both Ben Berg’s  Scratch extension and the iPad software that Paula wrote for the Reggio workshop. 

version 1: on the iPad version fade to color following a fade out produces strange results.

version 1a: fixes the fadeout bug and also uses the Arduino struct data type to simplify the coding. But 1a is not compatible with Ben’s Scratch extension.
